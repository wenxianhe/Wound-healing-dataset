We acquired second harmonic generation (SHG) images of collagen in mouse wound tissue at four different stages of healing: day 0, day 3, day 7, and day 10. 
All animal experiments adhered to a protocol sanctioned by the University of Macau’s Sub-panel on Animal Research Ethics (UMARE -019 - 2022).Male nude mice, aged 6-8 weeks and weighing between 20-23g, were sourced from the University of Macau’s animal facility.
The excisional wound splinting model was employed as delineated by X. Wang (2019). In summary, each mouse was anesthetized before two full-thickness skin wounds of 5 mm diameter were inflicted with a biopsy punch on either side of the midline. 
A silicone splint encircled each wound to maintain its position while a 3M Tegaderm dressing provided coverage. SHG imaging was performed on the wounded skin at specified intervals post-injury, specifically on days 0, 3, 7, and 10.
To obtain high-quality collagen image of wound areas in mice, the mice were euthanized with CO2. The wounds were then observed using a Nikon Eclipse Inverted Multiphoton Microscope (A1MP+Eclipse Ti-2E, Nikon instrument Inc., Japan) with a 40×NA=1.15 water-immersion objective.
Imaging was performed at an excitation wavelength of 1060 nm, with the average laser power maintained below 30 mW. SHG signals in the wavelength range of 506 nm to 593 nm were collected to capture collagen images.
